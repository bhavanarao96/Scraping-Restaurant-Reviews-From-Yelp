This was probably my favourite part of this specific meal.They also were doing beautiful bottle cocktails I got the milk punch. If you've never had milk punch I highly suggest you try it.

In fact, I've had cravings for Byblos in the past year. So, you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to learn that they were doing delivery via UberEats to Mississauga!!!I figured the food wouldn't last as well given the long commute, but it ended up pretty decent! There were a few dishes that didn't travel well, mainly the manti (cooled a bit and therefore lost its comforting charm), lamb ribs (again, cooled slightly so it was sweeter and stickier), and the pita (the condensation caused certain parts of it to become wet and moist; however, it was still quite soft and very warm!). The highlights were the roasted lamb shoulder - it was so nice to be able to make your own personalized wraps - and, of course, my favourite fig salad!A detailed review is as follows:Roasted lamb shoulderDon't be fooled by the appearance - this big fist-sized serving of meat is one chunky baby! The meat is packed tightly so it's very hefty. The gamey flavour is unmistakable, and the pickles and dips really helped balance and accentuate the profile. In fact, having the pickled radish on its own was not great, but combining it with the gamey lamb was delicious! Would definitely recommend. Fig saladUnsurprisingly, the salad wasn't affected by the long delivery commute. It was still as good as I remember! The sweet floral citrusy taste whet my appetite, combined with the tangy cheese, and I adored the crunch from the seeds and nuts.MantiFrankly, the manti was what I was most excited for - oh, how I adore Byblos' manti dumplings! Unfortunately, they cooled down a bit (and in my eagerness, I didn't heat them up) so the yogurt flavour was far more prominent. Still good with lots of complex flavour, but not amazing. Lamb ribsThese sweet, sesame coated ribs were yummy, despite having cooled. Again, in retrospect, I should've heated them up at the time, but they were still nonetheless delicious! A bit on the small side, however - each rib was as long as my index finger with not a whole lot of meat. Black truffle uffle pide and riceThis pide was good and still warm when it arrived. The dough was a little chewy but the earthy truffle flavour really came through. The rice was quite hot, despite the hour drive, but alas, the crispy onions and chickpeas on top had deflated. Don't be fooled by its small appearance; it's quite filling!Wagyu hummusOf all the dishes, this was the least impressive. The hummus was good, but it had a grainy texture. The minced Wagyu was also a bit tough - didn't seem like wagyu, frankly\",\n",

They have a wide variety of stuff - and even a price fixe menu which I tend to always stick with (they know what's best). I've only ever been to miku at dinner and it's always been a great experience with service - they know each dish, explain it throughly and are more than kind when serving. They really do deserve that $80-100 tip at the end!! The sushi there is always fresh and although sometimes the combo may seem weird, the chefs know what they're doing and the umami and taste just flow on the tongue. If they have wagyu ANYTHING, go for it - the best wagyu I've ever had in my whole life. It's crazy how vivid the taste is. Even the desserts are always spectacular. I love whatever they put together! The best part is that I never feel sickly full after it and although it may look small, it's a lot of food and will keep you content. Expect to drop at least $500+ on one meal though! AKA. do not bring a first date or someone you're casually seeing (make sure you guys are exclusive, or ask for separate checks! Lol)\",\n",

The sushi selection platter was extremely fresh and I love how I was able to try a little bit of everything (nigiri, roll and oshi sushi). The hokkaido scallop nigiri, amberjack nigiri and red wave roll stood out to me the most. Also the torched salmon roll literally melted in my mouth! For dessert, I got their 'Warm Matcha Valrhona Chocolate Fondant' which is basically a brownie with matcha lava inside that flows out! Since it was pretty sweet, there was the whisky ice cream on the side to help bring down the sweetness. The second dessert I got was their 'Green Tea Opera' which is a 7 layer cake (takes 3 days to make)! This cake had matcha buttercream, dark chocolate ganache, hazelnut wafer and more. I loved the fresh fruits on the side too! Overall both desserts were fantastic, 10/10! The service was excellent and I would definitely recommend if you're looking for some high end sushi!

Patrons can sit at a sushi bar during non-Covid times. Seating options include booths, banquettes and tables.I wanted to order the Miku signature sushi selection ($38), but our server advised that they couldn't leave off two allergens. That didn't make sense to me as presumably the sushi is made à la minute, and suggested that I was being steered towards more the expensive individual options, but I went along with it. The menu is limited in scope, so I ordered a few aburi selections. The server recommended their own torching method, which I accepted. My dinner came out with an allergen on it. I was hungry at this point, so I removed the items that I could eat and let them take away the offending item. One would have thought that they would have been horrified at the mistake, and brought two pieces, or at least taken that piece off the bill; that didn't happen. My guest ordered the miku roll ($22). I've known this particular person for decades and only seen him turn down his meal once. Until tonight. He took one bite, then I could tell from the look on his face that we had trouble.

Have been seeing so many people go, and was quite skeptical because it is pizza, and I'm not in love with pizza like many people tend to be. The size is good enough for one person to eat. Price is $12 (tax included) \\xa0for 2 topping custom pizza. About $15 for build your own. \\xa0Crust: I love it. It's quite thin if you get the original (default) way of the crust. It's not hard or crunchy, it's just right. I thought it would be hard, meaning that it would hurt my palate, but it wasn't hard at all. It was pretty soft but had structure, and it wasn't soggy. Just right. \\xa0Sauce: You have the choice of a few different sauces that they put on your pizza at the end. Kind of over killed my pizza with BBQ sauce, but it was still good enough. In the beginning when making your pizza, you have the choice of the typical sauces (red classic sauce; alfredo; etc.). \\xa0Toppings: There isn't an insane amount of toppings. For meats there is: meat ball; italian sausage; ground beef (?); pepperoni; ham; and I think one more. Then you have your typical choices of vegetables, and I don't fairly remember if there were any fruits. I feel like there could be more toppings but it's not a huge game changer, it's good enough. \\xa0Service: It's fine. You don't really get a lot of interaction with the employees because it's not a sit in restaurant (not really; it's more like a Chipotle). But they're generally pretty nice. If you're new to the whole place, they'll give you a quick overview of how things work. \\xa0Price: Not super expensive. I would say it's pretty good for what you get. $12 (after tax) for a 2 topping pizza (custom). \\xa0Around $15? For a build your own. I think you would generally go for a build your own. There are other options like premade pizzas that you can also customize. \\xa0Conclusion: I would really enjoy coming to this place again because of the many different options that you can have and different toppings that you can put. The size of the pizza is also not too big so you can easily (at least for me) finish it by yourself.The pricing is also fair imo and it's not like you're eating cardboard.

The noodles have a perfect thick and chewy texture (there is a thick or thin noodle option, which is nice), and the shittake mushrooms (which are only included in some of the dishes, and are extra toppings in others) are great and something not often found in other ramen restaurants.

Of course, expect the standard small ramen house, communal seating in the middle, but little to no seating outside of that. I could care less, but do not expect to stretch out here and or to have the children strolling around. Another aspect to consider is there is always a line, but they take your name and give you an estimated waiting time, so you can walk around the local neighborhood while you wait.When it comes to menu, very standard Japanese Ramen style menu, apps and ramen! I noticed a Tonkatsu Black, which peeked my interest, but it also helps many suggested it as well. Ramen was fairly quick as expected, which is great. After adding an additional egg, I was ready to go! Rating for it would fall between a 7 and a half and 8 out of 10.

Of course these were pretty pricey but they were definitely worth it. Mushroom Risotto- Honestly this risotto fell short. I am not sure if it just sat out on the plate for too long before they brought it to us but it was not hot or barely even warm. The grains were clumping together and it was not creamy like risotto should be. I also didn't really care for the flavor. A little disappointing. White Cheddar Popovers- Not bad! We like popovers and these were nice and fluffy, crispy on the outside and really tasty. At the end of the meal they brought us these delicious complimentary hand painted caramel chocolates and a muffin for each of us to have later. That worked out because we were heading to Niagara Falls in the morning and had a little snack for breakfast.

It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you. We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed. Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window.

Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more. The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you.

We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5. The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin. But overall, the experience was great. I just wish the steak was more tender and juicy and the caesar salad can be less sour or vinegary. Overall 8.5/5',\n",

Perfectly cooked, delicious Canadian chuck beef and basic toppings but done very well with high quality ingredients. The same the can be said for the chicken sandwich. I normally don't like slaw but it was the perfect acidity to cut the fat from the chicken. The fries were also crispy and soft.

We ended up having to take the rest to go because that thing was massive. My blush mojito was very tasty. The nachos were good but not my favorite nachos ever. They had olives, grilled bell pepper, pico and salsa which aren't my first choice of toppings. My only gripe was the $18.50 for the platter and the additional $7 for meat.

The lobster roll was everything I dreamed of, but for $25 I really expected more than a 4 inch roll with maybe a quarter cup of lobster. The whole thing took me all of 3 bites to eat, in less than 2 minutes. Tasty, but such a disappointment. Many mixed emotions here. On top of that, you have to order a side, but the price of the side is not included in the combo so I had to pay an extra $5 for fries, which was...not great. I'm glad they forced me to order the fries though, because they ended up being the main part of my meal since my lobster roll disappeared in 2 minutes.

I will start by saying that the flavor is really good. The pork inside is perfectly steamed and the broth was delicious. The dumpling skin has the perfect thickness - not too much dough but not so thin that the skin will break when being picked up. However, it is possible the xlb did not break because there was barely any soup inside. If you are like me and like to pour out the soup onto a spoon...you're going to have a difficult time getting enough soup out. I also ordered some pan fried items.

A set of stairs leads us down to the dining room, with a subdued but pleasant elegant decor. In the time of coronavirus, Stage 3, protocols are in place to ensure the safety of guests.For amuse bouche, we were offered a lovely refreshing tomato gazpacho, rich in wholesome flavors. It reminded me of an appetizer I enjoyed many years ago at Scaramouche; it was a corn soup, but while you might think \"corn soup at a fine dining restaurant?\", let me assure you that the kitchen had taken such a seemingly pedestrian dish and elevated it to heights that I was not expecting.I started my meal with an appetizer serving of the Gnocchi Parisienne (seasonal mushrooms, thyme, garlic, summer greens, truffled mushroom reduction, crispy Parmesan wafer). I love a well prepared gnocchi, and Scaramouche did not disappoint. The gnocchi was rich and buttery, the chanterelles were a perfect pairing for the truffled mushroom reduction, which was to die for.For my main I opted for the classic Grilled Filet Mignon (Ontario AAA beef, sauteed mushrooms, French green beans, crispy pressed potatoes with parsley, garlic and lemon, Bordelaise sauce). The dish was competently executed, the filet mignon was perfectly cooked, and the pressed potatoes were very nice in terms of texture and flavor. The only issue is that it was noticeable that the dish sat for too long under the heat lamp, and by the time it was served, it was overall lukewarm, instead of having been served hot.I finished the meal with a Scaramouche classic, its famous Coconut Cream Pie (coconut custard, Chantilly cream, white chocolate shavings, dark chocolate sauce). The custard is filled with coconut, topped with a light Chantilly cream; the white chocolate shavings add a creamy richness to the dessert, while the dark sauce enhances it with a chocolate punch. Service is professional and attentive. Our server, Andrew, has been with Scaramouche for many years and makes sure that patrons needs are taken care of. Regular and vegetarian menus are available.

But flavor/texture wise everything reflects the kitchen staff's solid skills and great selection of ingredients.For desserts - I'm less of a sweet tooth lately, but in the past I did like their coconut cream pie that I bought one whole pie to be my birthday cake (advance notice needed though for whole pie), and lots of my guests found it very unique and tasty. A single slice of it is pretty large still, and is indeed sweet and very rich in creams.Things to notice if first time going there:The location might be a bit difficult to find. It's in the basement level of a building. They do have a sign in front of the building though. Checking map before going wouldn't hurt :)Reservation is probably a must for Fridays and Saturdays. I tried calling them for available tables when close to the dinner hours and was told they were all sold out pretty much every single time. Weekdays might be easier.They have complimentary valet parking if you're driving to the restaurant\",\n",

The staff were always cleaning the empty tables and there were plastic shields separating the tables.I buy from here a lot and almost always order the same thing (original pork loin katsu). The sauce is super flavourful and has a lot of depth. Also, one notable dish was the chicken wings, even though they were covered with sauce, I was very pleasantly surprised that they were still really crispy. The only small thing I wish we had was the bottle of salad dressing, it used to be available on hand at the table but it wasn't today for some reason. But I'm sure they would have given it to me if I asked.I am really impressed with the service here, everyone is always incredibly respectful and friendly and they go out of their way to make sure you are always attended to.

I was seated immediately and my food came out really fast.I ordered the Original cheese katsu, specifically so I can get a great cheese pull video. It did not disappoint! The cheese was gooey and perfect! I thought the cheese to katsu ratio was great and the original sauce was the perfect addition to the dish. It wasn't heavy like a curry, it was lighter and it balanced out the heavy cheese and fried pork. The katsu itself was pretty good. The pork quality was ehhh and the panko was too fine for me. I prefer crispier katsu. I probably wouldn't get the katsu by itself, but I do like the whole combo together (cheese, katsu, and sauce).I also got the crabmeat croquette which was really good while it was fresh. When it sits for a while, it becomes a bit too creamy and squishy. The Tartar sauce / cheese / crab mixture doesn't hold up well so I recommend ordering this appetizer only if you are dining in.

E.g., \"if you must remove your mask, you can do so in these designated spaces and ensure there isn\\'t anyone around you.\" Also, maybe a warning that people who remove their masks will be asked to leave. A couple groups of guests around us would remove their masks every time staff were not around - that usually meant in the more confined spaces.PS.

I think it rivals the big aquariums of Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, etc., in the states.

              " ('With the highly coveted reservations already secured by a friend, I had absolutely no reason to decline an invitation to dinner at one of the most renowned fine dining restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even in Canada. I\\'ve had Aloette in the past and absolutely loved their menu so I was very excited to see what Alo had to offer. Asides from the rather.. interesting elevator ride up to the restaurant, which arguably felt like we were entering a speakeasy from how covert and dingy the elevator was, the overall restaurant experience was impeccable, a true reflection of fine dining. From the way the courses were meticulously served around table symmetry to the rotation and pairing of utensils for each individual dish, there was no detail that was missed. Even our lap napkins were replaced with fresh ones when we left our seats for the restroom.I have a lot of appreciation for the artistry and vision behind Chef Patrick Kriss\\' creation of our particular blind 9-course tasting menu (Sep 4, 2021). However, I was rather unimpressed by the execution of the Japanese-fusion twist and I had rather wished for the opportunity to experience authentic \"modern French cuisine\". Now hear me out, Japanese cuisine is undeniably my favourite cuisine of all time so perhaps my expectation for anything \"Japanese fusion\" was set too high. There\\'s no doubt that Alo used Japanese elements and ingredients of the highest caliber in each of the courses, but I felt that the flavours of the two cuisines just didn\\'t marry well. The appetizers and desserts, along with the foie gras tart, were mostly misses for me. Two of the appetizers that were served back to back, the burrata and the sea urchin egg yolk foam were both incredibly and overwhelmingly salty, with the latter taking away from the natural sweetness of fresh uni. The toro was served negitoro style, which from an aesthetics and palatability point of view felt inferior to what could\\'ve been an actual slice of toro. The foie gras, I can only comment that I found the yellow plum pairing far too tangy and tart. Even at the thought of it now, my face puckers. As I am not a foie gras connoisseur, I will share my friend\\'s positive review that it was \"very smooth\". And the petit fours, the six unique desserts that acted as the finale to the meal, were all very exciting to witness being laid out on a table all at once in front of us, but didn\\'t entice me all that much. Personally, I would\\'ve much preferred either a full traditional French tasting menu OR a full traditional Japanese tasting menu. Not a fusion that doesn\\'t do justice to either - that\\'s just my two cents.Now onto the dishes that really stole the spotlight for me - my three favourites in descending order were the amadai, scallop, and wagyu (+$85 in replacement of lamb). The culinary skill behind the amadai was absolutely incredible - a buttery and tender filet of fish lightly flash-fried on its backside to create crispy edible skin and scales. The jumbo scallop was my second favourite because it was also buttery and tender and served with a delicious umami crab bisque. The wagyu comes third because I thought it was an additional course for $85 rather than a replacement (couldn\\'t hear the waiter well behind face masks). As well, my piece unfortunately had a lot of tendon. For the rest of my table, everyone commented that the wagyu was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience, but my piece was chewy. All in all, I felt that my tasting menu at Alo was very creative and used some very bold flavour choices. While I personally did not love every dish that was served, I can appreciate the careful thought and design that went into each recipe. Seeing as my favourite courses were mostly entrees, I would probably opt for the a la carte menu rather than the tasting menu next time, should there be one. I\\'m happy to say now that I\\'ve \"been there, done that\" but I wouldn\\'t be inclined to say that I would definitely be back',\n",

As for food it was great even the small sides like bread and soup was a highlight. I had high expectations and dessert was the only thing that fell below that. Rasberry cheese cake, wasn't bad but didn't blow me out of the park. I guess it's kind of hard to do a visually appealing dessert for take out so I don't blame them.

We decided to give this place a try since it was close to where we were living, and boy did it not disappoint!Upon seating, our waiter kindly recommended the toroniku (simmer pork jowl), after noticing that both of our orders (Negi Meshi Bowl Combo with the Shoyu Ramen, and the Grilled Salmon Bowl Combo with the Miso Ramen) didn't include the specialty item - I'm so glad we got the separate appetizer. We were amazed at how tender and soft the toroniku came out. It was absolutely succulent and delicious, basically tearing apart at the muscles as we picked it up with our chopsticks. The marinade was just savoury enough to have a nice depth of flavour without ruining the natural flavour of the pork. It came with a side of scallions, which helped to clean your palate after every bite. I also tried combining both in one bite; the scallions of which offered a refreshing coolness to cut the richness of the toroniku.The shoyu ramen and miso ramen were absolute divine - first sips of the broth yielded deep, rich, and hearty flavours. This was definitely a broth that would warm you up on a cold rainy day. The ramen noodles themselves had a consistent bite throughout the meal, never once feeling soggy as if they absorbed too much broth. The cha shu itself was seared perfectly, with a perfect ratio of fat-to-meat. Unfortunately, we did feel as if the broth was a little too salty for our taste buds - but nevertheless, a great ramen indeed! For the next time, I think we'll try to adjust the broth richness. We saw on the menu that it was customizable, but didn't think too much about it seeing that our waiter didn't ask.Moving onto the Negi Meshi itself, I was pleasantly surprised at how the simple combination of rice, dried bonito, green onions and soy sauce came together in such a balanced dish. I found that the sweetness from the soy sauce helped to balance out the umami from the dried bonito, with the green onions adding a splash of freshness into every bite.

They only make a certain amount of the special each day, and when it\\'s out, it\\'s out. We both ordered the special and to our delight, the noodles and broth came out piping hot, and the toppings were served separately on a side dish. Some people may have found this odd, but we liked it because we were able to control how soaked we wanted the meat to be. We\\'ve often gone to ramen shops where the meat has disintegrated due to the high heat of the broth, and high heat can cause the meat to release extra oil into the broth, so if you don\\'t drink it fast, it starts to feel unpleasant as the fat begins to coagulate. The broth was DELICIOUS; the flavors were well rounded, hearty, and so savory. I\\'m literally salivating as I write this. We fell in love after this meal, and marked it as one of our \"must haves\" whenever we visit Toronto.On our next visit to Toronto, we took my husband\\'s cousin with us. Again, we got to the restaurant before opening and stood in a small line. My husband and his cousin ordered the Pork Jowl Ramen again, but I tried the Tsukemen Ramen this time.

My favourite is the kara-miso which is their spicy ramen. this one costs $1 more which is worth it if you like spicy. I've also tried and enjoyed their regular miso ramen and the dipping ramen. TBH, I do not enjoy the dipping ramen though. I also do not like the sour plum they put on one of the ramens because it is too sour, but I know some of my friends like it.The service here is also extremely fast. The only downside here is that their portions are literally the smallest I ever saw and at a price that is higher than average. I also don't think there is an option for how hard you want your noodles, or maybe the servers just dont ask?\",\n",

We were seated at the bar area, which was not very spacious and the steam from the kitchen made it quite hot for customers. I had the Shio Ramen, and I liked how the broth was flavorful but less salty compared to other ramen places. I would recommend getting a large bowl, as the portion sizes are on the smaller side.

However, the food there was quite disappointing. First of all, their prices for egg bennies are relatively higher than all the other brunch places I've been to in Toronto. The smoked salmon egg benedict was $19.99 but it didn't taste any more special than the other restaurants we tried. My friend ordered the classic egg benedict and it was just okay. Instead of the in-house salad, they gave us 2 pieces of honeydew. Because I like to judge the egg benny with the restaurant's selection of salad, this was a huge turn-off for me. The egg benedicts are very saucy but plain. We had to put in additional salt and pepper, even some hot sauce to fire up the flavour (which kind of ruined our experience). The only good thing was the fries. The fries were more buttery and added some additional texture/flavour to the dish. We also ordered their sangria which was okay. It wasn't the best sangria we have had, but it wasn't bad. Generally speaking, since it has an average of 4 stars on yelp with over 900 reviews, we thought this would be a great place for brunch but it ended up to be very disappointing. The food is at the pricier end but the flavour didn't match up with the price. Not recommended especially you are bringing a friend from out of the town\",\n",

The menu is filled with signature Pinoy dishes, but if you are here the Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fight is the reason for eating sit-down. Not eating it is the equivalent of not getting All-You-Can-Eat at an AYCE Sushi Place, or ordering Ala Carte from a Korean BBQ Place. The food is delicious and reminiscent of authentic Filipino cuisine, which is expected since the staff/chefs are actually Filipino/Filipina. The mussels, chicken/pork, shrimp and other meats are all marinated and cooked to be very moist and the rice and salad are seasoned perfectly. The only downside of the restauraunt is the size. Traditionally Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fights are shared with large families or large groups of friends. At this location its only a small amount of tables which max out at maybe 4-6 people?

              " (\"Came here for Valentine's day dinner with my boyfriend. Let's just say this place was on my list of restaurants I wanted to try since time. I'm a huge fan of Grant van Gameren. The vibe outside reminds me of a tavern you'd come across in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. Inside is just as romantic with dim red mood lighting. It's very romantic. We chose to do the set menu however, we didn't realize how much food was coming out. We weren't that hungry but we said what the heck. We told them we just definitely wanted to try the Octopus (pulpo is my favourite!).First course was the charcuterie and cheese with bread - I wasn't a huge fan of smoked meat or meat that looks raw but I gave it a chance and it went well with the cheese. Second course was the shishito peppers - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish as I've had really delicious shishito peppers in Madrid and this couldn't compare. I wish it was a bit more charred and crispy.Third course was the Sweetbread and raw tuna - two things that I normally do not eat but I wanted to be adventurous and sucked it up. This dish was surprisingly really tasty with great contrasting textures. The less you think about what sweetbreads are the better it began to taste haha..Fourth course was the ceviche - another dish that i normally do not eat since I generally don't eat raw fish but the flavours here were done very well and the fish was fried so crispy and used as a bowl to house the ceviche which i thought was very clever. By this course we were so full that we couldn't finish the ceviche. We also didn't finish the first course too.Fifth course was the octopus - I feel bad saying this but perhaps it was my high expectations but I had better octopus at Ricardo's. However, it was still very tasty though.Sixth course was the mushrooms - omg to die for. I can't believe after all these courses the mushrooms took the cake! It was the best mushrooms I've ever had. I would go back just for the mushrooms (not even for the octopus!) which speaks volumes.We ended off our night with the dessert courses...Seventh course - THE BASQUE CAKE - probably one of the simplest but most scrumptious desserts I've ever had. Would also come back just for the basque cake. Eighth and last course - ice cream bars covered in chocolate. This was basically like a tiny mini version of a Klondike bar. I wasn't impressed. Overall, I don't know if it was just a mix of my high expectations and the fact that I decided to be adventurous and got that basically handed to me with everything I don't usually eat. But I feel like I've had a better experience with a tasting menu at DaiLo but I gave it a try and the food here was really well done. That, paired with the vibes of this place, it's so romantic and a perfect date spot. However, quite pricey and be ready to spend a couple hundred dollars especially if you're ordered drinks (which we did)\",\n",

I'm not those diners who would turn on their phone flash light to read the menu but I wouldn't blame you if we did. The menu was pretty much entirely in Spanish but there were definitely a few winners. The Roasted Bone Marrow - Creamy, fatty and delicious. They do it so well here and I know they have this in most restaurants but get it here as well.Shrimp al Ajillo - This was the highlight of my meal actually, not the Grilled Octopus. The shrimp that they used were the giant red shrimps from Argentina so they were very meaty and juicy. I had my first one in La Banane and was mind-blown. These were cooked in a rich butter garlic sauce, and yes they were amazing.Basque Cake - I would come back just for this. You simply cannot go for a meal a Bar Isabel and not order the Basque Cake.

Every single dish had its unique flavours and textures which complimented each other while bringing different experiences to the table.

The chorizo verde was so tender, full of herbs and is the first ever sausage I would describe as light. The octopus was perfectly tender.

And a lot of my favourite items weren't there.

Good flavour. Tokyo fry (French fries with garlic mayo)- mc Donald's like French fries. Tasty. Nama grapefruit cocktail- you get to squeeze your own grapefruit. Picturesque.

Things I wouldn't order again:salmon nattoyukke (salmon sashimi/seaweed/onsen tamago)- the lightly cooked sunny side up egg mixed with the salmon sashimi seaweed salad just didn't suit my taste buds at all. I found it very unappealingly bland. My least favorite dish of the night. Kamo tataki (sous vide duck breast)- okay taste but dry. Hotate oshizushi (pressed scallop sushi)- bland Karaage - nothing special. Ebi mayo - all I could taste was fried batter doused in mayo. And I'm sad because I swear this used to be one of my favourites. Batter was quite thick. Takoyaki- good texture but the sauce was overly ketchup-y. Overpowered the overall taste.

It's their take on the long-running Summerlicious, where they offer a set course meal for an affordable price. It's a great way to sample the menu without breaking the bank.The 8-course menu offers a range of popular dishes that can be shared among friends and is only $29 per person (minimum of 2 people). If you're not into a tasting menu, then you will find that the menu offers a variety of traditional and modern specialties made for sharing.Course #1 - \\xa0We started our meal off with the Gomaee, which was blanched rapini in black sesame sauce. The black sesame sauce really added a nice kick to the veggie dish.  Course #2 - The second course was the Sashimi Platter. It was beautifully plated and came with a variety of fresh fish. Thickly cut too! Course #3 - Gyu Shabu SaladCourse #4 - The third course was the Angus Beef Yukke, which was angus beef tartare topped with scallion, raw quail egg yolk, and nori. It was a dish that I would never order as I don't eat raw beef, but my friend really enjoyed it. Course #5 - The Fry Platter was my absolute favorite of the night! It consisted of the three items that I always order whenever I am at a Kinka Family establishment including Kinton Ramen. Their gyoza is one of the best I've ever had, especially with the accompanying sauce. The takoyaki was plump and wasn't overly battered.Course #6 - The Kakimayo is very popular amongst diners. It's baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, garlic mayo and cheese. A deadly (if you're lactose intolerant), but a yummy combination.Course #7 - Next up before dessert was the Kinoko Bibimbap, which is a hot stone with rice, mushrooms, cheese, and seaweed sauce. It's a vegetarian dish, and you can mix it yourself or ask one of the servers. This dish was really good!Course #8 - We ended the night off with a scoop of Matcha Ice-Cream. Nothing special, but good. Kinka Izakaya also offers an everyday set menu with 10 courses for $35 per person. Overall, Kinka Izakaya is a very solid izakaya option in Toronto.

              " ('I came here with a group of friends mainly for their kinkalicious $29.99 set meal special and was slightly disappointed for a number of reasons: 1. The noise. I\\'ve been to the Yonge location before and thought it was a good level of excitement. I did see a lot of the warning reviews for this location but wasn\\'t expecting that level of noise. It\\'s not a good exciting type of noise, but the kind where you have to yell to talk and constantly repeat yourself. It gets super loud with the sake bombs- it\\'s only (kinda) nice when you\\'re the ones doing them. They shake these tin sounding things and it pierces your ears. 2. The service was not impressive. We had to ask our server for refills of water. Also, after the 6th course she asked if we were ready for dessert before we received our bibimbap. After we asked about it, she told us that the kinkalicious doesn\\'t come with the bibimbap, as it only applies to their regular set meal. We pulled out the menu and showed her. I don\\'t get how a server can\\'t know their own menu to that extent, especially when the kinkalicious is such a huge special going on. Had we just took her word for it, we would have been skimped out on the most filling dish... 3. They ran out of matcha ice cream. We were finishing off our dinner around 9.. maybe that\\'s a bit late but when any restaurant runs out of a main component it def doesn\\'t impress me. Especially when they have a special going on, they should prepare and overstock to ensure there will be more than enough to meet demand. 4. They didn\\'t allow us to split bills... just the full bill for the table. This is super inconvenient when you\\'re coming in a group, let alone a large group. 5. For the set meal, they don\\'t serve the dishes individually. They bring you dishes and say \"this serves 2/3\" and you have to figure out how to divvy it up yourselves. This isn\\'t ideal unless you have a s/o to partner up with... considering you\\'re paying an individual price per person, it would be nice to get individual portions. Those unimpressive points aside, the food was okay. The set meal is a cool experience because you get to try things you might not normally try. Izakaya foods are typically on the pricier size for the portions you get... but personally I wouldn\\'t pay the normal $35/person for the set meal, as I was still kind of hungry after. Overall, I much prefer the Yonge location because the atmosphere and noise level is more reasonable there',\n",

How KINKA isn't jam packed between noon and three is a mystery to me, but one I ultimately have little interest in solving. Knowing I can walk into KINKA on any afternoon and have an affordable, delicious, thoughtfully conceptualized lunch box without having to wait a minute in line is a joy I carry with me constantly. That being said, It also feels like a crime that more people aren't aware of this. The concept is simple - it's a bento style meal (plus soup) where you choose 1 food in four 'categories'. I've been making a point of eating less red meat and more fish, which means that my path to success is clear: sashimi salad, octopus takowasabi, grilled mackerel, and salmon don. Trust me when I tell you that everything I've listed tastes phenomenal. Having all of that on one plate is mind boggling - even more so when the bill comes. $13 pre tax and tip. That's it. As I mentioned, everything is delicious. The dressing on the sashimi salad combined with the crunchy fried garlic and peanuts is a perfect compliment to the sashimi itself, the takowasabi is gooey, strange, spicy, and perfect. The mackerel - served with what I think is minced radish with soy sauce and lemon - is yummy, and the salmon don is super fresh (gotta love that salmon roe too). I'll sum it up this way: as Toronto becomes more and more expensive, I've been on the lookout for things that make it worth the cost. Food experiences like this are certainly on that list\",\n",

I thought this was a fun experience to see what we were eating up close! They then proceeded to prepare them into different dishes.Our first dish was the crab leg tower where they had taken the crab legs, fried them, and coated them with a savory sauce. They may have been double fried but it was so delicious! They even cut open the legs so that they'd be easier to eat. The table had a box of gloves we could use in case we didn't want to get our hands dirty.Our second dish was almost like a lobster mountain! The picture I have does not do the dish justice since this was quite literally a massive pile of lightly fried lobster. Everything was so tender and juicy.

Closed for many months at the start of the pandemic, I knew that they had to be hurting. Emma's has a takeout portal on their website so I had ordered 30 minutes in advance.Ready for some cinnamon biscuits to christen my new freezer at home and to later enjoy Christmas morning, I also ordered some of their plain buttermilk biscuits. Heck since I was there anyway, a side of their delicious coffee and side of pancakes were in order.Service was friendly and quick which was great because of my parking job out front. I realized that the pancakes would not be as delicious when I would eventually get home, so I reluctantly found a nearby street to eat my pancakes. As I opened the bag I realized that I forgot to ask for cutlery. Noooooo! So I looked around the car and found 1 wrapped (clean) Starbucks straw and some napkins. Flashing back to my childhood I decided to burrito my pancakes. I used the straw to butter my pancakes and poured a tiny bit of syrup on. So burrito-ing pancakes works well with brown sugar or jam, but it is a disaster with syrup. Merde! Miraculously I had a bottle of hand sanitizer in the car, so then my whole car smelled of vanilla and candy canes.Somehow my shirt and jacket emerged unscathed. Unfortunate the coffee wasn't well suited to drinking and driving on Dufferin.

The biscuits and gravy was delIcious - peppery, flavourful and not gluey at all. The biscuit Itself is really good, but is not like a traditional buttermilk biscuit that is crumbly or salty. I actually prefer that type of biscuit, but that's a whole other story. The hot sauce that comes on the side is a must have - nice and spicy and compliments everything very well.If I had ONE criticism about ECK - it's the drinks. We had orange juice wIth our meal and it was 6$ a GLASS. No refills. I get it's fresh squeezed but that's pretty expensive.

Tried two different items of them: first time was the Egg Benedict with peameal bacon, the second time was a stack of pancakes.Egg Benedict was done nicely: peameal bacon had crispy parts but not dry, muffin was of the right thickness, egg was runny and sauce were rich. Nothing was missing at all :DFor the pancake, I especially liked that they had ricotta cheese with lemon zest on top of pancake, it tasted refreshing and only with a subtle hint of sweetness. To me that was much better than piling up overly sweetened and fattened whipped cream which is more commonly seen for pancakes.Given the experience I can say this place scored points for both savory and sweet plates.Serving portions were generous - they kept me full for the entire morning and a half of the afternoon. Good for people with a large stomach. They also have a lot of side dish options that essentially can give you a mini version of their food - for instance, one Egg Benedict. Probably it's also fun to do some mix and match.One last note - this place gets very busy on weekends, and from what I recall they don't take reservations.

              " ('Delicious breakfast! You want that in your life. Emma\\'s specializes in breakfast seven days a week and will make sure that you leave their restaurant satisfied and happy. You might have seen them on season 4 of You Gotta Eat Here! or noticed that blogTO named them the #1 Best All-Day Breakfast in town. They\\'re open from 8am to 3pm every day of the week - don\\'t expect to find any sort of dinner menu here - it\\'s breakfast and brunch comfort food all day, every day!When visiting on the weekend you can typically expect to be met with a bit of a wait to get in. They tend to move things along pretty quickly, but obviously the later that you arrive, the longer that the wait will likely be. I stopped in on a holiday Monday and the place was bumpin\\'. You\\'ll usually find them open on statutory holidays when lots of other spots opt to remain closed. The restaurant is fairly unassuming from the street, with their brown signage. On the inside you\\'ll find that the room is quite spacious, with a few tables up in the front and quite a lot more in the back. They underwent a renovation a few years ago which has really helped to maximize their space. The decor is minimal and the ambiance is warm, buzzing and welcoming.After a reasonable wait, we were seated at a table in the back section and were promptly served by the friendly wait staff.Emma\\'s wants you to enjoy fresh comfort food and that includes; bakery items that are made fresh in-house daily, using only local meats that they cure and smoke themselves, and freshly fried donuts. The menu is filled with the delicious classics that you crave and each one is done really well. As a tea drinker, I asked for Tea ($3.00) and chose English Breakfast since I enjoy black tea in the morning. Their tea is provided by Tea Squared, a company from Canada. I prepare my black tea with milk and sugar and enjoyed a perfectly warm and pleasant cup. Can\\'t go wrong with that! I also noted that Emma\\'s offers some pretty awesome brunch cocktails, and the Emma\\'s Caesar especially caught my eye. On another day when I\\'m feeling more \"fun\" I will certainly give it a try!There are lots of items on the menu; from their rotating (and usually seasonally appropriate) pancake flavours, to a daily quiche, to the classically southern biscuits and gravy. They\\'ve even got avocado toast for the millennials. However, their most renowned item has to be the Emma\\'s Benny (Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, soft poached eggs and smothered in mousseline sauce. Served with a side of red skin potatoes - $16.00), a must-try. The food arrived fairly quickly and I eagerly sliced into my perfectly poached eggs. Emma\\'s signature buttermilk biscuit is impossibly buttery and absorbs the surrounding egg yolk and mousseline mélange decadently well. The peameal bacon is truly something special, utilizing Toronto\\'s famous meat so well. Hormone and antibiotic free, their meats come from the best butcher in town; Sanagan\\'s Meat Locker. Their peameal is salty and tender, a delicious protein base. What\\'s the difference between mousseline and hollandaise sauce? It\\'s a richer version of the classic that uses whipped cream. As if hollandaise could get any better. This benedict is like a hug of happiness for your stomach.The potatoes were fine, a little bit plain. I could have used a bit more crisp on them, but they tasted good with salt and ketchup.Emma\\'s is pretty well-known for serving up some of the best donuts in town. Chances are that after eating a big, filling breakfast that you might not think that you have any room left for a donut. So take your donut to-go! You don\\'t want to miss out! Their flavours change all the time (Instagram is a reliable source to find out what they\\'ve got in the case each day) and on my visit they had one of their best ones; Maple Bacon ($3.25). A lot of people are doing a maple bacon donut. It\\'s a pretty trendy flavour. But it\\'s my opinion that Emma\\'s is doing the best version of it that I have ever tried. The way that they handle the bacon on this donut is by far the best. It\\'s ultra abundant and crumbly, capturing the salty and sweet combo expertly well. If your a fan of the maple bacon donut, this is the beginning and end of it right here!Emma\\'s Country Kitchen is a perfect little breakfast (not so) secret. They bring country flavours right into the city and serve up what you dream of for a classically delicious breakfast. You want this!',\n",

              " ('Honestly, this place is so bomb and if you don\\'t come, you\\'re actually missing out on life. This means if you arrive and they tell you it\\'s going to be an hour wait, you\\'re just going to have to wait an hour. I\\'ve actually never had to wait an hour though. I go pretty late and usually get seated almost right away. The one time I went at a more popular time (I think it was around 1:30), I waited 30-45 minutes, which really isn\\'t bad (I\\'m always lining up for something). Large tables will definitely have to wait longer. I\\'ve always been a party of 2. So every time I come, I order the biscuits and gravy and that\\'s life. This isn\\'t something super different or out of the ordinary and if you were to break down the dish into components, ya, it\\'s a regular breakfast but at the same time, I don\\'t know where else I can order a biscuits and gravy dish. Why else should you order it? It\\'s just so good, like how can you go on living without having it. How will you know what life means? It\\'s just hot delicious gravy with sausage (?) bits in it poured over a biscuit cut in half. It comes with soft scrambled eggs and fruits. Nothing to rave over. The fruits are fine but soft scramble egggggggs, that\\'s where it\\'s at! Why are you so creamy and delicious? I can\\'t live. It\\'s just bomb. Please get it. Oh, they also give you hot sauce which you can add on if you like. I can\\'t take the heat so no comment on how that tastes. Being the fatty that I am, I frequently get 3 dishes for 2 people so I\\'ve also had their quiche and their wild blueberry and ricotta pancakes. I am not a huge fan of pancakes \\xa0and honestly got it because everyone else around me was getting it but man, when greed does me well. I will admit I not a pancake connoisseur but these are good! If you get this (which you should), should definitely consider getting extra sauce because it\\'s really good. The quiche was good but compared to the above two dishes, not necessary (assuming you\\'re just one person because you can only eat so much). The breakwich, the benny, the classic is good. I don\\'t have much to say about these but it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not good. It\\'s just compared to the pancakes and the biscuits and gravy, they\\'re just \"good.\" However, if you\\'re comparing this to other brunch places, these dishes are still better than theirs, so don\\'t think you\\'re making the wrong decision if you order these. \\xa0I haven\\'t had everything on the menu so I can\\'t confirm if there are any wrong choices here BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT IT. Please don\\'t ask me about the doughnuts. They usually sell out before I get there or I just cannot possibly find any room my in stomach for them. Oh, people here are nice. I like them. Come',\n",

Gingerbread pancakes were on the menu the day we visited and each bite was a taste of the holidays. Emma's Benny was also a hit. Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, soft poached eggs and smothered in mousseline sauce. Can't go wrong with that! Served with a side of red skin potatoes, yum. Everything tastes homemade and quality ingredients are definitely used. Their sausage is also delicious. Our little one loved it, jam packed with flavor and not overly greasy or salty.

This is a place you'd want to visit with a group so you can try a bit of everything from the menu! It is a tapas style restaurant so you'll want to order a couple of items per person. Even though our table was incredibly full, we still made room for their dessert which was the sticky bun. One of our friends has a severe nut allergy and the kitchen was very accommodating, modifying dishes to remove any nuts. Service was also great, the food came out one after the other so we weren't sitting around hungry.

They are tapas style, the prices may make you think you are getting an entree size but they are meant for sharing and is small portion size. They were accommodating of dietary concern and try their best to work around it or offer you an alternative. The place is packed, very little spacing between tables. I was less than an arm length from the different group next to me, if you get up to use the washroom the other person has to move or you will be touching. it was too close and made everyone in our table and the other table uncomfortable. We ordered a number of items from the menu. Truffle gnudi, steak tartare and duck confit was our favourites. However after we got home we got a stomache, it might have been the tartare, the only person who didnt have the stomache did not have the tartare. I also do not recommend the ceviche, we had high hopes for it, but the fish did not taste right. We were told it's probably the seasoning, but something just was off. A week later, i tried a different restaurant and had their sea bream also saw and it definitely tasted better and not spoiled.- brussel sprouts $16- truffle gnudi $24 (there are 4 pieces of ghnochi)- spicy ceviche $18- steak tartare $28- duck confit $28- rasa burger $21\",\n",

This restaurant does absolutely everything right and I will explain why we loved it so much. Firstly reservations are booked online through Bookenda, super easy and quick. Not a lot available on a Tuesday night but we snagged an 8:15pm reservation. Once booked we got a confirmation email right from the restaurant and on the day of I got a text from a real person confirming the reservation. I was even able to ask about the menu via text and got a prompt, friendly response. Super cool and convenient!We arrived and were seated at almost exactly 8:15, our waiter showed up with some water right away and explained the menu to us. We opted for the classic tasting menu having never been there before, we wanted to sample their more well-known dishes. Our server was genuine, friendly, professional and funny throughout. Him and the rest of the servers were amazing and knowledgeable about each food item. Now for the food, everything we ate from the tapioca bun to the dessert was a complete 10/10. The flavours and textures were so incredible; complex, comforting, familiar, yet new and exotic all at the same time. I couldn't believe how good everything tasted. Portion sizes were perfect and my husband and I have bigger appetites. Everything was phenomenal but our highlights were the burger and the sticky bun for dessert. I can go on all day about each individual dish but I'd be writing a novel if I did that. The restaurant is kind of cozy, rustic, but cool and modern at the same time. It's casual and down to earth. These aren't cheap eats but the value is 100% spot on. The tasting menu is $65/person but I think it was well worth it, considering dining anywhere in Toronto will often cost around that if not more. I don't know why I waited so long to dine here but it's a new favorite for sure, I'll be recommending Rasa to all my friends and family because it's too good to miss. This is a true gem and all the good reviews are truly deserved. I have not a single negative thing to say about this establishment.

The great music, vibe and staff are truly want drives this place and make this establishment what it is. The staff is incredibly helpful when it comes to menu choices.So why did I dock one star? I made a reservation on OpenTable and only discovered on the day of my reservation that it was a Detroit location and that this was a known problem. Yikes. I happened to call ahead of time to let them know I was running late and was told they didn\\'t have my name on the list. I got the feeling they would have accommodated us anyways if we did turn up because that is just the kind of people they are.I also called and left a voice message the night before asking to change my reservation time but no one got back to me. If someone did call me back we would have discovered well ahead of time that I didn\\'t have a reservation, rather than 15 mins away from the restaurant after driving down 40 mins. Having said that, the food is great but the ceviche was a miss. Maybe it is just me but the peanut sauce was not a good mix. The chopped salad is the star of the show. The burger was great (it doesn\\'t come with anything folks, just bun and patty so don\\'t be looking for anything under the plates like us LOL) but the pasta was VERY salty. Got a dish with round items on it (I can\\'t remember what it was) but it was also salty.I think my friends mentioned a few times it was my birthday. I had mentioned it too when I made the reservation.

The menu on the night we ordered takeout, Saturday October 24th, consisted of hen, sides of your choosing, Alo rolls and salad. For the sides we went with the roasted Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes.Every dish was cooked and salted perfectly and there was an incredible balance of flavours and textures - it was just unbelievable!All of the dishes were packaged well and the reheating instructions were spot on.Hands down the best takeout food I\\'ve ever had in my entire life. I would definitely order Alo at Home again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to have a special meal at home. Five stars': 'positive',\n",
              " \"$14 for 2 pieces of fish of your choice, for which I ordered cod (they had haddock, and halibut listed inside; about $5 for 1 piece if sold separately/extra), with fries (about $3 extra to make it a poutine, which I did),and a tiny \\xa0container of (unpleasant) tartar sauce and 2 lemons slices (awesome!). I asked for the 'Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter' which was about $2.00 extra. $14 for all that is a good deal for the location. The poutine portion was massive. \\xa0Not bad. Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter was \\xa0underwhelming.The fish were fine. BUT please make sure you let the fish cool down, or the batter falls off easily.The main gripe i had is the tartar sauce: it tasted like the sweet tartar that Heinz makes. Inexcusably sweet in flavour. Best tartar sauce Im comparing it to was/is the Whole Foods hot bar tartar sauce from Yorkville. Overall, doesnt beat the fish and chips that Yorkville Whole Foods offered/offers Friday evenings after 4 PM. WF use a beer batter that clung to the fish fillet.And WF tartar sauce is night and day better (at least not sweet!)\": 'positive',\n",
              " \"***This review is for delivery so I kept the rating but will give comments in review***Given that I live in Mississauga and can no longer easily access downtown in the pandemic, I miss Toronto food significantly. In fact, I've had cravings for Byblos in the past year. So, you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to learn that they were doing delivery via UberEats to Mississauga!!!I figured the food wouldn't last as well given the long commute, but it ended up pretty decent! There were a few dishes that didn't travel well, mainly the manti (cooled a bit and therefore lost its comforting charm), lamb ribs (again, cooled slightly so it was sweeter and stickier), and the pita (the condensation caused certain parts of it to become wet and moist; however, it was still quite soft and very warm!). The highlights were the roasted lamb shoulder - it was so nice to be able to make your own personalized wraps - and, of course, my favourite fig salad!A detailed review is as follows:Roasted lamb shoulderDon't be fooled by the appearance - this big fist-sized serving of meat is one chunky baby! The meat is packed tightly so it's very hefty. The gamey flavour is unmistakable, and the pickles and dips really helped balance and accentuate the profile. In fact, having the pickled radish on its own was not great, but combining it with the gamey lamb was delicious! Would definitely recommend. Fig saladUnsurprisingly, the salad wasn't affected by the long delivery commute. It was still as good as I remember! The sweet floral citrusy taste whet my appetite, combined with the tangy cheese, and I adored the crunch from the seeds and nuts.MantiFrankly, the manti was what I was most excited for - oh, how I adore Byblos' manti dumplings! Unfortunately, they cooled down a bit (and in my eagerness, I didn't heat them up) so the yogurt flavour was far more prominent. Still good with lots of complex flavour, but not amazing. Lamb ribsThese sweet, sesame coated ribs were yummy, despite having cooled. Again, in retrospect, I should've heated them up at the time, but they were still nonetheless delicious! A bit on the small side, however - each rib was as long as my index finger with not a whole lot of meat. Black truffle uffle pide and riceThis pide was good and still warm when it arrived. The dough was a little chewy but the earthy truffle flavour really came through. The rice was quite hot, despite the hour drive, but alas, the crispy onions and chickpeas on top had deflated. Don't be fooled by its small appearance; it's quite filling!Wagyu hummusOf all the dishes, this was the least impressive. The hummus was good, but it had a grainy texture. The minced Wagyu was also a bit tough - didn't seem like wagyu, frankly\": 'positive',\n",

We came specifically because they had wagyu on the menu nut we were also excited to try their Ribeye as well.Aside from our drinks (which were delicious)we ordered:6oz Iwate prefecture wagyu and 14oz Ribeye- Both Steaks were cooked to perfection and every bite was just heavenly. Of course these were pretty pricey but they were definitely worth it. Mushroom Risotto- Honestly this risotto fell short. I am not sure if it just sat out on the plate for too long before they brought it to us but it was not hot or barely even warm. The grains were clumping together and it was not creamy like risotto should be. I also didn't really care for the flavor. A little disappointing. White Cheddar Popovers- Not bad! We like popovers and these were nice and fluffy, crispy on the outside and really tasty. At the end of the meal they brought us these delicious complimentary hand painted caramel chocolates and a muffin for each of us to have later. That worked out because we were heading to Niagara Falls in the morning and had a little snack for breakfast. Overall we really enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back the next time we are in town to see what other Wagyu options they have on the menu!\": 'positive',\n",
              " \"*pre covid review*My bf and I came here *twice* during the week we were on vacation in Toronto. The first time we got take out and it was so good that we actually took the time to go to the restaurant in person too. For take out we ordered an insomnia burger, a fried chicken sandwich and the hand cut fries with garlic aioli. The burger was delicious. Perfectly cooked, delicious Canadian chuck beef and basic toppings but done very well with high quality ingredients. The same the can be said for the chicken sandwich. I normally don't like slaw but it was the perfect acidity to cut the fat from the chicken. The fries were also crispy and soft. They did get a little soggy from the drive but the garlic aioli made up for it. When we went in person I got a blush mojito and we just did the epic nachos to share between us. We ended up having to take the rest to go because that thing was massive. My blush mojito was very tasty. The nachos were good but not my favorite nachos ever. They had olives, grilled bell pepper, pico and salsa which aren't my first choice of toppings. My only gripe was the $18.50 for the platter and the additional $7 for meat. I just thought that was a little pricey. I would of rather had less chips, different toppings and not have to pay extra or at least that much extra for meat. Overall we loved the food and would highly recommend coming here. The restaurant itself has an awesome welcoming and casual vibe and we will definitely order from here again next time we're in Toronto\": 'positive',\n",

The eggs Benny with smoked salmon was good - it came in a croissant - but wow the pancakes...these pancakes were incredible. I have not tried pancakes like this ANYWHERE.

The rosemary fries come with a delicious sauce too, switch things up from your regular fries.The only downside was I got a message from ritual our order was ready but we had to wait 10-15 minutes longer.

The burger, made with beef cheek and brisket, and lifted with pickle and kimchi on a homemade black sesame sprinkled bun was scrumptious. Excellent asian chopped salad.

This restaurant does absolutely everything right and I will explain why we loved it so much. Firstly reservations are booked online through Bookenda, super easy and quick. Not a lot available on a Tuesday night but we snagged an 8:15pm reservation. Once booked we got a confirmation email right from the restaurant and on the day of I got a text from a real person confirming the reservation. I was even able to ask about the menu via text and got a prompt, friendly response. Super cool and convenient!We arrived and were seated at almost exactly 8:15, our waiter showed up with some water right away and explained the menu to us. We opted for the classic tasting menu having never been there before, we wanted to sample their more well-known dishes. Our server was genuine, friendly, professional and funny throughout. Him and the rest of the servers were amazing and knowledgeable about each food item. Now for the food, everything we ate from the tapioca bun to the dessert was a complete 10/10. The flavours and textures were so incredible; complex, comforting, familiar, yet new and exotic all at the same time. I couldn't believe how good everything tasted. Portion sizes were perfect and my husband and I have bigger appetites. Everything was phenomenal but our highlights were the burger and the sticky bun for dessert. I can go on all day about each individual dish but I'd be writing a novel if I did that. The restaurant is kind of cozy, rustic, but cool and modern at the same time. It's casual and down to earth. These aren't cheap eats but the value is 100% spot on. The tasting menu is $65/person but I think it was well worth it, considering dining anywhere in Toronto will often cost around that if not more. I don't know why I waited so long to dine here but it's a new favorite for sure, I'll be recommending Rasa to all my friends and family because it's too good to miss.

Other notable tapas we tried was the Ceviche. It was almost like a guac but the fish was plentiful and fresh with the in house chips (seasoned with paprika too!). The Tomato bread was alright.Atmosphere felt super European. Especially since we came during the COVID outdoor patio season, their street side tiny tables for 2 set up was very minimal and Chic.

From the moment we passed security, we were greeted with nothing but friendly smiles, and we knew that we were in for a treat. Once we got up to the restaurant, we were quickly brought to our seats, and were in awe at the view. We went at night, so seeing all the glistening lights across the GTA was truly a treat. The entire vibe was very romantic, and perfect for couples. Food - 9/10I got an appetizer of Steamed PEI Mussels and a main of lamb. The serving of mussels was very generous, and they provide a few pieces of bread with it to soak up the sauce at the bottom of the pot, which was a very nice touch. The lamb was incredibly tender, and cooked perfectly! Service - 9/10Service was phenomenal, and we were treated so well. If I wanted to be extremely nit-picky, the only flaw throughout the entire night was that we waited for ~10 minutes to get the bill after we asked for it. BUT with the view that you get while dining, we didn't mind the wait at all! This place is definitely on the pricey side, so I suggest saving this for a special celebration or occasion.

Traditionally Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fights are shared with large families or large groups of friends. At this location its only a small amount of tables which max out at maybe 4-6 people?

We told them we just definitely wanted to try the Octopus (pulpo is my favourite!).First course was the charcuterie and cheese with bread - I wasn't a huge fan of smoked meat or meat that looks raw but I gave it a chance and it went well with the cheese. Second course was the shishito peppers - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish as I've had really delicious shishito peppers in Madrid and this couldn't compare. I wish it was a bit more charred and crispy.Third course was the Sweetbread and raw tuna - two things that I normally do not eat but I wanted to be adventurous and sucked it up. This dish was surprisingly really tasty with great contrasting textures. The less you think about what sweetbreads are the better it began to taste haha..Fourth course was the ceviche - another dish that i normally do not eat since I generally don't eat raw fish but the flavours here were done very well and the fish was fried so crispy and used as a bowl to house the ceviche which i thought was very clever. By this course we were so full that we couldn't finish the ceviche. We also didn't finish the first course too.Fifth course was the octopus - I feel bad saying this but perhaps it was my high expectations but I had better octopus at Ricardo's. However, it was still very tasty though.Sixth course was the mushrooms - omg to die for. I can't believe after all these courses the mushrooms took the cake! It was the best mushrooms I've ever had. I would go back just for the mushrooms (not even for the octopus!) which speaks volumes.We ended off our night with the dessert courses...Seventh course - THE BASQUE CAKE - probably one of the simplest but most scrumptious desserts I've ever had. Would also come back just for the basque cake. Eighth and last course - ice cream bars covered in chocolate. This was basically like a tiny mini version of a Klondike bar. I wasn't impressed. Overall, I don't know if it was just a mix of my high expectations and the fact that I decided to be adventurous and got that basically handed to me with everything I don't usually eat.

It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you. We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed. Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window.

Do not hesitate to ask them if you have any questions, they are more then welcome to assist you and give you suggestions.We ordered 2 drinks. Both very strong in alcohol flavors and less juicy or soday. Im not much of a drinker, so that was a bit too strong for me.The bread came after. Huge, fresh, crispy but soft in the side. Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more. The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you.

We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5. The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin.

              " 'Delicious breakfast! You want that in your life. Emma\\'s specializes in breakfast seven days a week and will make sure that you leave their restaurant satisfied and happy. You might have seen them on season 4 of You Gotta Eat Here! or noticed that blogTO named them the #1 Best All-Day Breakfast in town. They\\'re open from 8am to 3pm every day of the week - don\\'t expect to find any sort of dinner menu here - it\\'s breakfast and brunch comfort food all day, every day!When visiting on the weekend you can typically expect to be met with a bit of a wait to get in. They tend to move things along pretty quickly, but obviously the later that you arrive, the longer that the wait will likely be. I stopped in on a holiday Monday and the place was bumpin\\'. You\\'ll usually find them open on statutory holidays when lots of other spots opt to remain closed. The restaurant is fairly unassuming from the street, with their brown signage. On the inside you\\'ll find that the room is quite spacious, with a few tables up in the front and quite a lot more in the back. They underwent a renovation a few years ago which has really helped to maximize their space. The decor is minimal and the ambiance is warm, buzzing and welcoming.After a reasonable wait, we were seated at a table in the back section and were promptly served by the friendly wait staff.Emma\\'s wants you to enjoy fresh comfort food and that includes; bakery items that are made fresh in-house daily, using only local meats that they cure and smoke themselves, and freshly fried donuts. The menu is filled with the delicious classics that you crave and each one is done really well. As a tea drinker, I asked for Tea ($3.00) and chose English Breakfast since I enjoy black tea in the morning. Their tea is provided by Tea Squared, a company from Canada. I prepare my black tea with milk and sugar and enjoyed a perfectly warm and pleasant cup. Can\\'t go wrong with that! I also noted that Emma\\'s offers some pretty awesome brunch cocktails, and the Emma\\'s Caesar especially caught my eye. On another day when I\\'m feeling more \"fun\" I will certainly give it a try!There are lots of items on the menu; from their rotating (and usually seasonally appropriate) pancake flavours, to a daily quiche, to the classically southern biscuits and gravy. They\\'ve even got avocado toast for the millennials. However, their most renowned item has to be the Emma\\'s Benny (Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, soft poached eggs and smothered in mousseline sauce. Served with a side of red skin potatoes - $16.00), a must-try. The food arrived fairly quickly and I eagerly sliced into my perfectly poached eggs. Emma\\'s signature buttermilk biscuit is impossibly buttery and absorbs the surrounding egg yolk and mousseline mélange decadently well. The peameal bacon is truly something special, utilizing Toronto\\'s famous meat so well. Hormone and antibiotic free, their meats come from the best butcher in town; Sanagan\\'s Meat Locker. Their peameal is salty and tender, a delicious protein base. What\\'s the difference between mousseline and hollandaise sauce? It\\'s a richer version of the classic that uses whipped cream. As if hollandaise could get any better. This benedict is like a hug of happiness for your stomach.The potatoes were fine, a little bit plain. I could have used a bit more crisp on them, but they tasted good with salt and ketchup.Emma\\'s is pretty well-known for serving up some of the best donuts in town. Chances are that after eating a big, filling breakfast that you might not think that you have any room left for a donut. So take your donut to-go! You don\\'t want to miss out! Their flavours change all the time (Instagram is a reliable source to find out what they\\'ve got in the case each day) and on my visit they had one of their best ones; Maple Bacon ($3.25). A lot of people are doing a maple bacon donut. It\\'s a pretty trendy flavour. But it\\'s my opinion that Emma\\'s is doing the best version of it that I have ever tried. The way that they handle the bacon on this donut is by far the best. It\\'s ultra abundant and crumbly, capturing the salty and sweet combo expertly well. If your a fan of the maple bacon donut, this is the beginning and end of it right here!Emma\\'s Country Kitchen is a perfect little breakfast (not so) secret. They bring country flavours right into the city and serve up what you dream of for a classically delicious breakfast. You want this!': 'positive',\n",

The bartender did not hesitate to share what liquor she used upon inquiry - I ended up purchasing a handle of the Soho lychee liquor when I got back to the states and now use it in everything. I'm struggling to recreate the drink though because white cranberry juice is near impossible to find here.We chose a handful of oysters from their extensive list to create a dozen and by the time we were wrapping up our meal, we realized it was oyster happy hour, so we ordered a dozen more! My happy sentiments about the oysters resonates among all the other seafood items we ordered except for the tandoori cod, which was overpowered by seasoning and seemed to be a strange addition to the menu. The scallops and raw shrimp were excellent though.We ordered the bread pudding to wrap up our meal and the spices were perfect to warm our bellies before heading back out into the cold. Before dessert arrived, I made a trip to the restroom and on the way back up the stairs, I noticed black sesame cake written in chalk on one of the pillars, so obviously we ordered that as well since it's one of my favorite flavors.

We decided to give this place a try since it was close to where we were living, and boy did it not disappoint!Upon seating, our waiter kindly recommended the toroniku (simmer pork jowl), after noticing that both of our orders (Negi Meshi Bowl Combo with the Shoyu Ramen, and the Grilled Salmon Bowl Combo with the Miso Ramen) didn't include the specialty item - I'm so glad we got the separate appetizer. We were amazed at how tender and soft the toroniku came out. It was absolutely succulent and delicious, basically tearing apart at the muscles as we picked it up with our chopsticks. The marinade was just savoury enough to have a nice depth of flavour without ruining the natural flavour of the pork. It came with a side of scallions, which helped to clean your palate after every bite. I also tried combining both in one bite; the scallions of which offered a refreshing coolness to cut the richness of the toroniku.The shoyu ramen and miso ramen were absolute divine - first sips of the broth yielded deep, rich, and hearty flavours. This was definitely a broth that would warm you up on a cold rainy day. The ramen noodles themselves had a consistent bite throughout the meal, never once feeling soggy as if they absorbed too much broth. The cha shu itself was seared perfectly, with a perfect ratio of fat-to-meat. Unfortunately, we did feel as if the broth was a little too salty for our taste buds - but nevertheless, a great ramen indeed! For the next time, I think we'll try to adjust the broth richness. We saw on the menu that it was customizable, but didn't think too much about it seeing that our waiter didn't ask.Moving onto the Negi Meshi itself, I was pleasantly surprised at how the simple combination of rice, dried bonito, green onions and soy sauce came together in such a balanced dish. I found that the sweetness from the soy sauce helped to balance out the umami from the dried bonito, with the green onions adding a splash of freshness into every bite. Definitely one of my more memorable bites of the evening. The Grilled Salmon bowl was delicious - I just wish there was more salmon!I can't wait to come back again!\": 'positive',\n",

Some people may have found this odd, but we liked it because we were able to control how soaked we wanted the meat to be. We\\'ve often gone to ramen shops where the meat has disintegrated due to the high heat of the broth, and high heat can cause the meat to release extra oil into the broth, so if you don\\'t drink it fast, it starts to feel unpleasant as the fat begins to coagulate. The broth was DELICIOUS; the flavors were well rounded, hearty, and so savory. I\\'m literally salivating as I write this. We fell in love after this meal, and marked it as one of our \"must haves\" whenever we visit Toronto.On our next visit to Toronto, we took my husband\\'s cousin with us.

I don\\'t get how a server can\\'t know their own menu to that extent, especially when the kinkalicious is such a huge special going on. Had we just took her word for it, we would have been skimped out on the most filling dish... 3. They ran out of matcha ice cream. We were finishing off our dinner around 9.. maybe that\\'s a bit late but when any restaurant runs out of a main component it def doesn\\'t impress me. Especially when they have a special going on, they should prepare and overstock to ensure there will be more than enough to meet demand. 4. They didn\\'t allow us to split bills... just the full bill for the table. This is super inconvenient when you\\'re coming in a group, let alone a large group. 5. For the set meal, they don\\'t serve the dishes individually. They bring you dishes and say \"this serves 2/3\" and you have to figure out how to divvy it up yourselves. This isn\\'t ideal unless you have a s/o to partner up with... considering you\\'re paying an individual price per person, it would be nice to get individual portions. Those unimpressive points aside, the food was okay. The set meal is a cool experience because you get to try things you might not normally try. Izakaya foods are typically on the pricier size for the portions you get... but personally I wouldn\\'t pay the normal $35/person for the set meal, as I was still kind of hungry after. Overall, I much prefer the Yonge location because the atmosphere and noise level is more reasonable there': 'positive',\n",

The cheese was flavorful and smooth, and included a good mix of different cheeses (not sure which ones though). The bread was dry but okay to eat when drowned in cheese and I think they give you free refills. For the main, I had the hog wild flatbread.

It consisted of the three items that I always order whenever I am at a Kinka Family establishment including Kinton Ramen. Their gyoza is one of the best I've ever had, especially with the accompanying sauce. The takoyaki was plump and wasn't overly battered.Course #6 - The Kakimayo is very popular amongst diners.

I guess it depends on who you ask quite honestly. First off, the price tag is crazy, coming in over $30 dollars, maybe that is normal for aquariums, but I felt that was quite steep. Thankfully again, the pass covered it! Second, this is a mecca for kids, while I expected it, it did not make it easy to navigate or see everything. When you want to get up close and personal, basically I was run over by the Sandlot Crew. That is not a hit on the aquarium though honestly. The problems came down to lack of staff assistance when you lose yourself in this large complex or assistance with anything in general. I also felt it was quite run down in places and dirty to top it off. You would think with the relatively medium sized complex, it would be tidy and clean. On the plus side, you did get a lot of useful education from the different housed specimens here, so that is a huge plus if you are a sponge for wildlife. There are also tons of hands on with animals if you have the young ones with you.

The plate is assembled neatly, two eggs are enough even if it doesn't look like much in the plate.

              " \"In my opinion, this place is overrated on Yelp. I went there with my friend on Canada Day. We joined the waitlist on Yelp so the wait wasn't too bad. However, the food there was quite disappointing. First of all, their prices for egg bennies are relatively higher than all the other brunch places I've been to in Toronto. The smoked salmon egg benedict was $19.99 but it didn't taste any more special than the other restaurants we tried. My friend ordered the classic egg benedict and it was just okay. Instead of the in-house salad, they gave us 2 pieces of honeydew. Because I like to judge the egg benny with the restaurant's selection of salad, this was a huge turn-off for me. The egg benedicts are very saucy but plain. We had to put in additional salt and pepper, even some hot sauce to fire up the flavour (which kind of ruined our experience). The only good thing was the fries. The fries were more buttery and added some additional texture/flavour to the dish. We also ordered their sangria which was okay. It wasn't the best sangria we have had, but it wasn't bad. Generally speaking, since it has an average of 4 stars on yelp with over 900 reviews, we thought this would be a great place for brunch but it ended up to be very disappointing. The food is at the pricier end but the flavour didn't match up with the price. Not recommended especially you are bringing a friend from out of the town\": 'positive',\n",

              " 'In the dynamic culinary world in Toronto, where so many restaurants open and close their doors, Scaramouche Restaurant is an institution that has graciously withstood the test of time.Nestled in a quiet residential street in leafy South Hill, the restaurant enjoys a privileged view of the downtown core; while not as dramatic as the views from the 54th floor of TD Tower, the view is still a lovely backdrop to exquisite meals.Upon arrival, complimentary valet parking is available for patrons. A set of stairs leads us down to the dining room, with a subdued but pleasant elegant decor. In the time of coronavirus, Stage 3, protocols are in place to ensure the safety of guests.For amuse bouche, we were offered a lovely refreshing tomato gazpacho, rich in wholesome flavors. It reminded me of an appetizer I enjoyed many years ago at Scaramouche; it was a corn soup, but while you might think \"corn soup at a fine dining restaurant?\", let me assure you that the kitchen had taken such a seemingly pedestrian dish and elevated it to heights that I was not expecting.I started my meal with an appetizer serving of the Gnocchi Parisienne (seasonal mushrooms, thyme, garlic, summer greens, truffled mushroom reduction, crispy Parmesan wafer). I love a well prepared gnocchi, and Scaramouche did not disappoint. The gnocchi was rich and buttery, the chanterelles were a perfect pairing for the truffled mushroom reduction, which was to die for.For my main I opted for the classic Grilled Filet Mignon (Ontario AAA beef, sauteed mushrooms, French green beans, crispy pressed potatoes with parsley, garlic and lemon, Bordelaise sauce). The dish was competently executed, the filet mignon was perfectly cooked, and the pressed potatoes were very nice in terms of texture and flavor. The only issue is that it was noticeable that the dish sat for too long under the heat lamp, and by the time it was served, it was overall lukewarm, instead of having been served hot.I finished the meal with a Scaramouche classic, its famous Coconut Cream Pie (coconut custard, Chantilly cream, white chocolate shavings, dark chocolate sauce). The custard is filled with coconut, topped with a light Chantilly cream; the white chocolate shavings add a creamy richness to the dessert, while the dark sauce enhances it with a chocolate punch. Service is professional and attentive. Our server, Andrew, has been with Scaramouche for many years and makes sure that patrons needs are taken care of. Regular and vegetarian menus are available. Please be advised that bread is a separate charge, which in my personal opinion is poor form for fine dining establishments.TLDR; great food, great service, nice ambiance, recommendedthomassu.smugmug.com/Foo…': 'positive',\n",

So burrito-ing pancakes works well with brown sugar or jam, but it is a disaster with syrup. Merde!

The table had a box of gloves we could use in case we didn't want to get our hands dirty.Our second dish was almost like a lobster mountain!

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Philz Coffee remains my favorite coffee shop in the US, and the reason behind it is because you interface as much with the barista and his or her own specialties and recommendations as you do with the institutions itself. That's the case here at Fahrenheit as well, with barista names and nicknames on the board, high fives all around, and a fantastically jovial atmosphere that really gets your day off on the right foot. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$5.10 for a medium Mocha was a reasonable price point, and everything was priced comparably down to their cookies and pastries. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?One of the other real appeals that drew me into Fahrenheit and Philz alike is the ability to choose your bean regardless of the drink you order. As I've said before, I'm not at all a coffee snob, but in choosing between three different beans for my mocha with cool little descriptions below each, I could easily become a full fledged third wave fanboy, which is a cool feeling when it's not done in a way that's intimidating.

Seated by the window, right beside the downtown skyline, which looked amazing at night. The server was very kind and knowledgeable. Asked for some drink recommendations and the server recommended something that was not on the menu. As the entrees were shared, the server suggested serving them already split for the table. That was a nice touch.Presentation of each dish was clean and everything tasted absolutely amazing. Roasted duck breast paired with pan seared foie gras and duck broth was heavenly. This must be one of the best dishes; this was the dish the chef chose compliments of the house. The crispy pressed potatoes with the filet mignon, simplicity at its best. Not a huge fan of coconut but the coconut cream pie was light and not overly sweet.Overall, if the wallet can afford it will definitely be back !!

The quality of dishes has been extremely stable and decent across multiple visits in several years. I couldn't recall a single time that myself or some other people in my parties feel something is a disappointment. My personal favorite is probably the Foie Gras Terrine - that seems to be an item always staying on the menu... but I don't mind having it all the time, it's so irresistibly flavorful and smooth. The dishes are cooked and presented in a more old-fashioned fine dining way - no fancy foam or gel. But flavor/texture wise everything reflects the kitchen staff's solid skills and great selection of ingredients.For desserts - I'm less of a sweet tooth lately, but in the past I did like their coconut cream pie that I bought one whole pie to be my birthday cake (advance notice needed though for whole pie), and lots of my guests found it very unique and tasty. A single slice of it is pretty large still, and is indeed sweet and very rich in creams.Things to notice if first time going there:The location might be a bit difficult to find. It's in the basement level of a building. They do have a sign in front of the building though. Checking map before going wouldn't hurt :)Reservation is probably a must for Fridays and Saturdays.

I had purchased a city pass which included the tower, so I was not gonna miss out on it! This was also the perfect day to do so, since it was 7 degrees outside with negative temps with wind chills (No bueno for this Californian). Lines were relatively short and the ride up is unlike any other tower experience I have come encountered with. Typically you are stuck in an elevator with no views, until you get to the top, not here though. On your way up, you get to view all the way down the building and scenes from around Toronto with its outward facing windows. The ride itself to the top is short, so make sure you have your camera ready if you want those iconic shots you see littered all over the page. Before we talk about the two upper levels, make sure you hit the attraction on a clear day. I was short on my tourist days, so I opted to hit it on a winter day with heavy overcast. This ended up giving me terrible distant views, while I could catch decent near shots of downtown Toronto, outside of that, no luck. Moving forward with the idea of a clear day visit. The top floors have what you expect, food and drink options with places to sit and take in the views. They also have staff walking around educating you on parts of the city and the tower itself, which I found very valuable. In the end, would I hit the tower again, probably not by myself due to the price tag. If a friend was with me though who had never seen it, I would join immediately though!\": 'positive',\n",

The restaurant has adapted during covid19 with their patio area, which is an extension on the sidewalk and not dangerously on the street (like some other restaurants). Takeout seems to be the popular choice and the ordering counter is now right at the door. Ordering is fast and efficient. I understand that the noodles are the star of the show, but I wish there were more topping options. I pretty much saw either minced pork or slices of beef. Also some veggies (like bok choy) would be a \\xa0nice addition. There's a wide variety of noodle thickness and I went for an order of thick and thin. I agree with some reviewers that thick noodles give it a bit more texture and chewiness. But I prefer the thin noodles. The soup is clear and generally is smooth tasting, with a bite as a finish - an acquired taste.Overall, not bad and I did appreciate the noodles. However there are many noodle options in Toronto nowadays and I'm likely to rather give a new place a try.Thanks GB Noodles for the tasty lunch!\": 'positive',\n",

I particularly recommend their eggplant, which, though it costs extra, is worth every penny.Though not pictured, I also indulged in Mystic's famous apple cake---a delicious treat that's got a bit of crunch up top but is perfectly moist everywhere else. So delicious I got half a pan of it ($11) to share at work and nobody could stop at just having a slice.I look forward to trying more menu items and knowing where I can go for delicious and fairly priced cakes for potlucks and gatherings!\": 'positive',\n",

Well, this is the time to take advantage of this opportunity.Alo is one of Canada's top restaurant so good luck trying to get a reservation during a normal period. But now it's much more accessible.

You still get to enjoy the layers of flavor, save yourself the money and pick up your own fav wines from LCBO and enjoy it at the comfort of your own home.I say a lovely experience to enjoy for a special occasion or during the holidays.

They also have their own Spotify playlist which you can play during your dinner to bring up the mood.We got the package during the summer and enjoyed in our newly furnished balcony in the summer and it was just the best experience. As for food it was great even the small sides like bread and soup was a highlight. I had high expectations and dessert was the only thing that fell below that. Rasberry cheese cake, wasn't bad but didn't blow me out of the park. I guess it's kind of hard to do a visually appealing dessert for take out so I don't blame them. Our set is $160 incl. tax tip for 2 in their rotating menu, less than what it would be for their dine-in experience. This could make for a wonderful gift or for a special occasion\": 'positive',\n",

You can request to be seated at the bar if you like the bar vibe.As you walk through the restaurant you will smell the aromatic curries, pad thai, noodle dishes, \\xa0fried squash fritters, spring rolls, etc. The Northern Thai platter looked so yummy. I will definitely order that next time.We ordered the Khao Soi and Gaeng Massaman. Khao Soi is fresh egg noodles in a golden coconut milk curry.

There's also crispy deep fried noodles served on top kind of like garlic bread with pasta. 4/5Gaeng massaman is a peanut tamarind curry also with choice of protein or tofu veggie.

Everything we tasted was good, but my partner found the wagyu lahmeh a little too spicy and the lamb ribs a little too sweet. Same for the branzino- the sauce was delicious, but a little too much and kind of overpowered the fish itself. The other dish we had was the brussels sprouts and they were yum but again nothing that \"wow\\'ed\". I will say their old fashioned was great and our server was great too.

              " 'With the highly coveted reservations already secured by a friend, I had absolutely no reason to decline an invitation to dinner at one of the most renowned fine dining restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even in Canada. I\\'ve had Aloette in the past and absolutely loved their menu so I was very excited to see what Alo had to offer. Asides from the rather.. interesting elevator ride up to the restaurant, which arguably felt like we were entering a speakeasy from how covert and dingy the elevator was, the overall restaurant experience was impeccable, a true reflection of fine dining. From the way the courses were meticulously served around table symmetry to the rotation and pairing of utensils for each individual dish, there was no detail that was missed. Even our lap napkins were replaced with fresh ones when we left our seats for the restroom.I have a lot of appreciation for the artistry and vision behind Chef Patrick Kriss\\' creation of our particular blind 9-course tasting menu (Sep 4, 2021). However, I was rather unimpressed by the execution of the Japanese-fusion twist and I had rather wished for the opportunity to experience authentic \"modern French cuisine\". Now hear me out, Japanese cuisine is undeniably my favourite cuisine of all time so perhaps my expectation for anything \"Japanese fusion\" was set too high. There\\'s no doubt that Alo used Japanese elements and ingredients of the highest caliber in each of the courses, but I felt that the flavours of the two cuisines just didn\\'t marry well. The appetizers and desserts, along with the foie gras tart, were mostly misses for me. Two of the appetizers that were served back to back, the burrata and the sea urchin egg yolk foam were both incredibly and overwhelmingly salty, with the latter taking away from the natural sweetness of fresh uni. The toro was served negitoro style, which from an aesthetics and palatability point of view felt inferior to what could\\'ve been an actual slice of toro. The foie gras, I can only comment that I found the yellow plum pairing far too tangy and tart. Even at the thought of it now, my face puckers. As I am not a foie gras connoisseur, I will share my friend\\'s positive review that it was \"very smooth\". And the petit fours, the six unique desserts that acted as the finale to the meal, were all very exciting to witness being laid out on a table all at once in front of us, but didn\\'t entice me all that much. Personally, I would\\'ve much preferred either a full traditional French tasting menu OR a full traditional Japanese tasting menu. Not a fusion that doesn\\'t do justice to either - that\\'s just my two cents.Now onto the dishes that really stole the spotlight for me - my three favourites in descending order were the amadai, scallop, and wagyu (+$85 in replacement of lamb). The culinary skill behind the amadai was absolutely incredible - a buttery and tender filet of fish lightly flash-fried on its backside to create crispy edible skin and scales. The jumbo scallop was my second favourite because it was also buttery and tender and served with a delicious umami crab bisque. The wagyu comes third because I thought it was an additional course for $85 rather than a replacement (couldn\\'t hear the waiter well behind face masks). As well, my piece unfortunately had a lot of tendon. For the rest of my table, everyone commented that the wagyu was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience, but my piece was chewy. All in all, I felt that my tasting menu at Alo was very creative and used some very bold flavour choices. While I personally did not love every dish that was served, I can appreciate the careful thought and design that went into each recipe. Seeing as my favourite courses were mostly entrees, I would probably opt for the a la carte menu rather than the tasting menu next time, should there be one. I\\'m happy to say now that I\\'ve \"been there, done that\" but I wouldn\\'t be inclined to say that I would definitely be back': 'positive',\n",
